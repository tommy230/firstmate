# The lock once used `mkdir` as its atomic primitive. mkdir is NOT atomic on
# every filesystem - on WSL2's filesystem several concurrent mkdir calls were
# observed to all succeed on one path, which silently double-granted the lock and
# made the watcher singleton and wake-queue draining race. The lock now uses an
# O_EXCL create (atomic everywhere we run). This test fails loudly if the lock
# ever stops being mutually exclusive again.
